                                With this new member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on
                                developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced;
                                to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users.
                                The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 digitizes source material such as bound documents at
                                high speeds in up to 400 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the
                                creation and manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4 models.
                                The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether
                                it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and
                                binding during digitization.
                                The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees;
                                enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original
                                subject matter.
                            </p>

                        <h2 class="product-tab mint">Book scanning made easy</h2>
                        <div class="product-tab">
                            <p>
                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device.
                                Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 can reach
                                unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external
                                peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It takes approximately 1.1 seconds for the Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 to capture and process the
                                images of two pages of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution.
                                Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as
                                brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan.
                                Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands
                                on the touchscreen.
                                Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive, sent via email, printed on a connected
                                or network printer, or uploaded to an FTP Server or Cloud.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V3's solid build, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an
                                ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library.
                                Some of the advantages of using a Bookeye&reg; 4 instead of a standard copier include
                                the Bookeye&reg;'s built-in book cradle for gently handling bound materials, its speed
                                and
                                simplicity of operation, and the fact that the resulting digital images substantially
                                reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to print scanned material.

                                Scanning: Image Access scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful
                                your
                                computer is. We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops.
                                We're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output
                                are
                                dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer
                                rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your
                                workstation
                                at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2
                                Gigabit or less).

                College</p>
            <p id="QID59"> ........ We always have long lines to use our 6 KIC scanners! - University of Houston </p>
            <p id="QID60"> ........ Our KIC was so popular - always a line of students waiting to use it - we had to
                purchase a second one! - University of Alaska </p>
            <p id="QID61"> ........ KIC is AWESOME!" - University of Oregon .......... We LOVE our KIC book scan
                stations! - University of Iowa </p>
            <p id="QID62"> ........ The KIC interface seems to be better designed based on staff and student comments. -

            <p id="QID65"> ........ We love our KIC system, it is so much cooler than the Ivina. KIC looks like it is
                from the 21st century, the other one looks like it is from a hundred years ago. Also we love the fact

                other technology our library has, that students would use them. No, instead they say 'You guys have a
                KIC!! That is so Cool!' - Miami University of Ohio </p>
            <p id="QID68"> ........ Without a doubt, the KIC BookEdge is a great machine. But the service we

            <p id="QID69"> ........ People love the KIC Bookeye 4 scanner, they love using the cradles. - Columbia Law
                School </p>
            <p id="QID70"> ........ Our administrators have noted that photocopier activity has gone down in the past
                years, and they are attributing that to KIC ... the quality of the scans are excellent ... The Bookeyes
