            <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0108">Study, Report, Research, Collaborate ... Digitally</h1>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0109">KIC Bookeye 4 is an indispensable tool for research, study and
                production of enhanced quality reports and papers with crystal
                clear color and black & white excerpts from books, magazines and
                very large journals. In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand
                system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC can
                be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Interlibrary Loan departments.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0110">With its 600 dpi option, KIC Bookeye 4
                systems are perfect as shared resources,
                capturing the finest details for digital
                archival and preservation.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0111">The KIC Bookeye 4 can capture 20 book pages per minute for
                instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy
                transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size more than
                40% larger than its nearest competitor, Bookeye 4 is also the only
                high resolution scanner in the world that supports both v-cradle and
                flat modes, and can scan material as large as 24 x 17 inches.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0112">Photocopiers, fax machines, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter
                up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. KIC Bookeye.4
                reverses that trend, replacing copiers and fax machines and
                adding scanning in a single machine with clean lines and efficient
                design.</p>

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0201">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h1>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top
                "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
                the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually
                all institutions of higher
                learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but
                since 2010 libraries have begun
                to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public
                Libraries</h1>
            <h2 id="BE4-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest
                book
                scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
                provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
                scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
                KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

            <h2 id="BE4-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
                they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0208">
                maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
                failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
                still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier
                than shuffling paper.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for
                paper copies to levels that
                make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
                use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
                scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
                mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

            <h2 id="BE4-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy.
                Users can compose,
                review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's
                step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is
                an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for
                the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

            <h2 id="BE4-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally
                must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method
                of charging users for copies and faxes.</p>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins"
                on regular letter-sized paper in any denomination that you like, cut them
                out, and sell them to users at the circulation desk or wherever you
                collect fees for late book returns.</p>

            <h2 id="BE4-0216">KIC Compatible with Copy Card & Cash Systems</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0217">All KIC systems are compatible with all
                standard copy card and coin-op devices. Since KIC transfers images to users' computers
                electronically, costly expendables are avoided, even for color! The library
                can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

            <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0503">KIC Bookeye 4 walk-up scanning stations are face-up scanners
                that save a lot of time and reduce book spine damage because they
                capture two face-up pages of a book with each scan and do not
                require the user to flip the book twice for each page. KIC analyzes
                each image, and automatically splits it into two separate images.
                In addition, black edges are automatically removed and the content
                is straightened, producing clean, professional looking images
                - important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials
                and research reports. These automatic image treatment functions
                also save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

            <h2 id="BE4-0505">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

            <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0506">The capture area of copiers is about half that of KIC Bookeye 4
                while the capture area of typical consumer scanners is smaller
                still. With a 18 X 24 inch capture area, Bookeye 4 captures it all!</p>

                quality book scanner that's also ideal for self-service.</p>
            <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0513">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
                which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. That's why
                affordable digital cameras have fewer than 50 megapixels. And those
                pixels must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>
            <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0514">Since books don't move while being scanned, the Bookeye
                4 is able to utilize linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels.
                Each pixel
                in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.
                However, high resolution scanning is meaningless if the lens
                system does not produce highly focused images. Since ultra-high resolution</p>
            <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0515">"spy satellite" lenses are quite
                expensive, the Bookeye 4 scans from left to right, allowing
                it to follow the curve of an open book and maintain
                excellent focus, whether in V-mode or flat mode.</p>
            <p class="block_text11" id="BE4-0516">The Bookeye 4's left-to-right scanning
                allows it to follow the contours of virtu- ally

                images than other book scanners that

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0704">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch
                screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send
                or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to
                use.
                The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a
                flash
                drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the
                flash drive.
                Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0705">KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
                true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
                need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0706">The tabletop model KIC Bookeye 4 has all the True2Touch capabilities
                of
                the full-size KIC. It has its own tabletop version of the SmartDock, and
                of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table. ADA
                compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to

                    usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to

                <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast
                    and DPI so users can easily follow their screen activity.

                <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of

                <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
                <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to
                    where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted
                    to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan
                    so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating
                    a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research
                    with others.

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0713">Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h1>

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0714">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone
                makers relent- lessly
                pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany
                reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
                will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our
                window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0715">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a
                very large
                touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling
                to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
                KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than
                any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful
                user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

            <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0716">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned,
                allow- ing
                the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

            <p class="block_text17" id="BE4-0717">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and
                touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's
                why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and
                equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

            <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the
                days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and even
                public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of
                tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic
                libraries for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the de- mand
                for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in public
                libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

            <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0804">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of re-
                search
                into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that ma- terial
                on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can
                be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely
                valuable. In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go
                hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2)
                their existing print collections contain vast amounts of information
                that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive
                to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

            <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
                copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo-
                copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

            <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
                to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
                major photocopier brands use a distributed
                service model.</p>

            <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
                because KIC has split the scan/copy
                functions into three separate machines,
                choosing the best of breed for each. As a
                result, KIC offers the best book scanners
                by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
                (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
                laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
                KIC system, so you can optimize costs
                and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

            <p id="BE4-0808">ADF attachment scans<br>

            <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye
                4 system with three color copiers and with three black and white
                copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic
                libraries. One KIC Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers
                because its face-up operation yields well over two times the perfor-</p>

            <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0811">mance of a typical copier. The costs
                are broken into three main areas: equipment
                and maintenance, consumables, and
                patron usage time. With KIC, electronic
                output is assumed to be preferred over
                print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged
                from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain
                to rise in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

            <p class="block_text21" id="BE4-0816">KIC Bookeye 4 handles thick books beautifully. Its contour-<br>finding
                laser allows it to flatten even the most curved books<br>
                and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automati-<br>cally
                adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0817">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

            <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
                a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
                spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
                has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

            <ul class="peppermint" id="BE4-0820">
                <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
                    or other face-down scanning machines.
                </li>
                <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
                <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
                    the copier will be used.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0821">In the digital world, there is no paper,
                toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
                images, whether black and white or color.</p>

            <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
                but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
                patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
                fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
                machine couldn't be justified.</p>

            <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
                So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
                the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
                fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
                toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
                of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

            <h3 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and
                books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Bookeye 4 and
                other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see
                what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates
                the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning
                pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that Face-Down
                scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of Face-Up
                systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book
                on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in
                the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                and the patron.</p>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning systems
                involves only the basic movement required to set a book
                down and turn a page.</p>

                to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.</p>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0916">In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative speed
                and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not require
                the user to flip over the book being scanned. Once placing
                the book, the user simply turns pages and presses the scan
                button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>

            <h3 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0918">Monitor Usage Statistics at a Glance</h3>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0919">Control,update and monitor your KIC systems remotely. To
                better serve your patrons, it is important to know which KIC
                systems are used the most and at what times during the
                day and week, and which are used the least. All usage statistics
                can help you to determine the best KIC configuration
                for each site. And to make it easier to navigate from KIC to
                KIC system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select a particular
                KIC system via either of two methods: a map or a list.</p>

            <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0920">With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                product available today. However, DLSG engineers inces- santly
                work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                digital world. DLSG offers improved software re-</p>

                Manager lets you
                update KIC systems remotely. For example, a recently released feature
                lets you turn KIC systems on and off on demand or on a schedule set by a
                central control panel.</p>

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1001">The Hybrid Library</h1>

            <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's
                existing print collections must be available in digital
                format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty
                to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti- zation,
                providing a valuable conduit between your print
                collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and
                smart devices.</p>

            <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage
                your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

            <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the
                world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

            <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each
                digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize
                content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

            <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze
                more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to
                support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza- tion
                Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a
                KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network.
                When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns
                to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

            <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators
                and faculty, simply write
                a department password file to a flash
                drive. When a user plugs in the USB
                'key', KIC recognizes the password and
                allows the user to save scanned images to shared folders.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

            <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It
                is impossible to affordably provide service personnel living in every
                city and town across America that are highly trained on the
                very special technologies needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG
                designs remote serviceability into its products and has perfected
                remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

            <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1012">The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly
                provide loaner/swap-out equipment and to go on site whenever
                necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions
                in service for your patrons.</p>

            <h2>The Hybrid Library</h2>
            <span>A message to students</span>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13Books.png" alt="">
            <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of which
                can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over many
                years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law, this
                knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until the books
                disintegrate.</p>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13People.png" alt="">
            <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book scanning
                machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20 pages per
                minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce higher-quality
                digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper</p>
            <p>copiers. The images can cost as little as 1&cent;
                per page and are readable on tablets &amp; smart phones as well as notebooks and regular PCs. The images
                can
                be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard copy.</p>
            <h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
            <p>Paper copiers are as necessary as ever in administrative areas across campus, but copier companies don't
                want to give up that one place they no longer belong, the library floor.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, book spines are being damaged, paper is being wasted, and students are not seeing their
                libraries as the vast free sources for scholarly knowledge that they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brochure-block" id="CCM-14">
            <h3>What can be done?</h3>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Scanners.png" alt="">
                Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to inform the
                libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book scanners that can
                print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular institution. Every year,
                libraries spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet of
                new high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control ever any of that budget money. At these
                institutions, faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase
                these units. If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much
                students value getting unlimited, free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the
                effort to scape together the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Women.jpg" alt="">
                Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student technology
                funds.). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one medium KIC
                and one large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much easier
                to justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched copier
                companies that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
            <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic copies
                replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems that scan up to
                20 pages per minute.</p>
            <span>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used?</span>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Copier.jpg" alt="">
                Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used? That is
                just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital (digitize on demand),
                you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide contract with a
                copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>copiers damage books and waste paper</li>
                <li>copiers are slower than scanners</li>
                <li>digital is the future <i>(and copier companies have had digital for over 10 years!)</i></li>

                            <p>
                                With the latest member of the Bookeye family, Image Access placed an emphasis on
                                developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced;
                                to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users.
                                The efficient Bookeye 4 digitizes source material such as bound documents at high speeds
                                in up to 600 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A2.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the
                                creation and manufacture of the Bookeye 4.
                                The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether
                                it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and
                                binding during digitization.
                                The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees;
                                enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original
                                subject matter.

                                Bookeye 4 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device.
                                Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye 4 can reach
                                unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external
                                peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It takes approximately three seconds for the Bookeye 4 to capture and process the images
                                of two pages of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution.
                                Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as
                                brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan.
                                Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands
                                on the touchscreen.
                                Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive, printed on a connected or network
                                printer, uploaded to an FTP Server or even sent via eMail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bookeye 4's solid functionality, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an
                                ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library.
                                The advantage of a Bookeye 4 over a normal copier is the protective handling of the
                                subject matter to be scanned and the immediate availability of the resulting images to a
                                wider audience.
                                Distribution of the scanned material can be virtually paper free - an ecological
                                argument for Bookeye 4.
