            </p>

            <h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0102">Complete Interlibrary Loan Scanning</h2>
            <h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0103">and Image Treatment Workflow System</h2>
            <h2 class="block-title-sub" id="ILL-0104">... better image quality, fewer errors, and easier operation</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0105">In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital
                document delivery, the available software was simple and
                image quality expectations of requestors were low. Times
                have changed. The demand for faster workflow delivery and
                perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software
                environment complex, creating significant challenges in
                training new employees. BSCAN ILL simplifies existing
                processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0106">BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter
                requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the
                information that is required by interlibrary loan document de-
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0107">livery software from
                scanned pull slips, not
                only saving time but also
                eliminating human error.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0108">Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed
                face-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2
                & V1. By eliminating the constant book flipping required
                by flatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to
                five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and
                they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume
                ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge flatbed
                scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster
                mode that scans two pages at a time.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0109">Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL's powerful image
                treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and
                remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0110">Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through
                ILLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange,
                Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notify ILLiad/Odyssey
                in each case, all without any need for further human
                intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.

            <h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0210">BSCAN ILL<br>
                Dramatically Improves ILL Digitization</h2>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0211">A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
                research community together is open sharing of newfound
                knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
                pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
                Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent
                on their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0212">In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
                had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment
                to meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document
                delivery software and there were no scanners made
                specifically for scanning books, journals and maps. Over
                time, that changed. Planetary scanners became available in
                the late 1990s. The first release of BSCAN ILL automatically
                read (using OCR) the requestor information from pull slips
                without manual keying, supported rapid scanning and image
                cleanup, and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a
                single button. Since then, ILLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
                and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN ILL
                with the same hands-off automation. BSCAN ILL has a host
                of valuable features, many of which are not available with any
                other system.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0213">In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource
                sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival,
                electronic course materials creation, scanning projects), only

                without the additional cost of color copiers or color micro-

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0709">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
                which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. Afford-<br>
                able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels
                must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which
                can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0710">Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ
                linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels.
                Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

            <p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0711">Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-<br>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0712">Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror
                system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the corners of the
                image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also
                scan in V-mode or flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the

                            <p>The new WideTEK 25 wide format flatbed scanner is the fully
                                re-engineered successor to the WideTEK A2. Doubling the optical resolution, while
                                offering
                                the higher scanning speed, guarantees an excellent image output. The WideTEK 25 can scan
                                just about anything: from business cards to diagrams in A2 format, books, newspapers,
                                maps,
                                bound documents and more. The scanner needs only three seconds to scan the largest
                                format.</p>
                            <p>Nearly all functions can be executed directly at the scanner via the integrated touch
                                screen. The Scan2Net&reg; technology from Image Access forms the basis of the innovative
                                user interface: intuitive to use via web browser or touch screen, providing the operator
                                with direct control over practically every scanner function. Using the touch screen
                                display, up to 30 different (password protected) jobs can be defined and stored. This
                                allows operators to create and store templates and choose any predefined location on one
                                of the network drives as a target for the scanned images.</p>
                            <p>The integrated walk-up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. It
                                allows the user to scan and send images to a specific destination such as a network
                                printer, any directory in the network, or to a USB stick; without having to work with a
                                client PC. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the image, all through the use of the
                                touch screen.</p>
                            <p>A further innovative feature of the WideTEK 25: All optical components are encapsulated
                                in a hermetically sealed camera box, making it not only dust-free but also very low
                                maintenance. Cleaning the mirrors and the mechanics is no longer required. State of the
                                art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime (50,000 hour lifetime)
                                and excellent scan results at a very low noise level in spite of its high speed.</p>
                            <p>The WideTEK 25 guarantees results at production scanning speeds for high throughput while
                                delivering images in brilliant colors.</p>

                            scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful your computer is. We do a
                            full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We're the only scanner
                            company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are dependent upon the
                            transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is twice as fast
                            as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds,
                            while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less). <a
