                        the
                        digital generation to try something different is to use lots of visuals. Just as restaurants
                        publish
                        images of their dining areas and their menu items online, with the introduction of KIC

                        Most libraries have a lot of volumes that haven't been checked out in a long time, and libraries
                        certainly can increase their relevance in the digital age by adding collaboration and study
                        spaces.
                        So it is rather compelling to cull books from the library.

                        The main argument against culling/moving books off-site is the unknown, but potentially great

                        that your unabridged collection can have in inciting the very uncommon, but equally special
