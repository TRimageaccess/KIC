            <h2>KIC Usage Statistics</h2>
            <p>KIC usage reports say it all! Consistent and reliable system metrics are crucial
                tools to determine the value of any hardware and/or software solution.
                KIC systems automatically generate statistical usage reports every day.
                The system is configurable, so library management can opt to email the reports
                to one or more designated KIC 'administrators' for review and analysis.</p>
            <p>During a recent study conducted on KIC usage, reports from 24 busy systems
                in the field showed a total of over 338,000 scans in a single month.
                That's an average of 14,000 scans per KIC system monthly.
                With KIC, color is free, but assigning a value of only 10&cent; to each image results
                in a value of $1,400/month provided to students and faculty.
                That translates to a full return on investment in under 15 months, which is
                the primary reason academic and research libraries are purchasing enough KIC systems
                to substantially replace copiers.</p>

            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/DeliveryStats.png" alt="Delivery Stats">
            <p>While USB drives (pocket-sized memory devices) are overwhelmingly popular,
                email is a very important method of acquiring scanned images from KIC systems.
                Originally thought by academic library administrators to be a much needed output option,
                FTP is used only about 1% of the time.</p>

            <h2>File Format by library Type</h2>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/FormatStats.png" alt="Format Stats">
            <p>While it's not surprising that the JPEG file format is most popular with
                art and architecture libraries, it's interesting to see how the popularity of
                PDF versus JPEG varies among libraries. Also, it seems that medical and law students
                have little use for the TIFF file format.</p>

            <p class="caption">The following two graphs show that KIC systems are worth walking to,
                whether they are side-by-side or spread out throughout the library.</p>

            <p class="caption">The higher and faster growing usage rates of the side-by-side systems
                in the graph above may be the result of more active sharing of the many ways that
                images can be used in an academic environment.</p>
