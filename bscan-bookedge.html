            <h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0103">and Image Treatment Workflow System</h2>
            <h2 class="block-title-sub" id="ILL-0104">... better image quality, fewer errors, and easier operation</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0105">In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital
                document delivery, the available software was simple and
                image quality expectations of requestors were low. Times
                have changed. The demand for faster workflow delivery and
                perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software
                environment complex, creating significant challenges in
                training new employees. BSCAN ILL simplifies existing
                processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0106">BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter
                requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the
                information that is required by interlibrary loan document de-
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0107">livery software from
                scanned pull slips, not
                only saving time but also
                eliminating human error.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0108">Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed
                face-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2
                & V1. By eliminating the constant book flipping required
                by flatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to
                five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and
                they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume
                ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge flatbed
                scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster
                mode that scans two pages at a time.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0109">Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL's powerful image
                treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and
                remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0110">Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through
                ILLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange,
                Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notify ILLiad/Odyssey
                in each case, all without any need for further human
                intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.

            <h2 class="block-title" id="ILL-0210">BSCAN ILL<br>
                Dramatically Improves ILL Digitization</h2>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0211">A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
                research community together is open sharing of newfound
                knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
                pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
                Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent
                on their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0212">In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
                had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment
                to meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document
                delivery software and there were no scanners made
                specifically for scanning books, journals and maps. Over
                time, that changed. Planetary scanners became available in
                the late 1990s. The first release of BSCAN ILL automatically
                read (using OCR) the requestor information from pull slips
                without manual keying, supported rapid scanning and image
                cleanup, and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a
                single button. Since then, ILLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
                and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN ILL
                with the same hands-off automation. BSCAN ILL has a host
                of valuable features, many of which are not available with any
                other system.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0213">In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource
                sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival,
                electronic course materials creation, scanning projects), only

                without the additional cost of color copiers or color micro-

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0709">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
                which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. Afford-<br>
                able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels
                must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which
                can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0710">Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ
                linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels.
                Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

            <p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0711">Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-<br>
                ing action of scanners allow them to<br>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0712">Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror
                system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the corners of the
                image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also
                scan in V-mode or flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the

                to focus on the special needs<br>
                of academic, research and public libraries. And just as Bookeye quickly became the leading book<br>
                scanner, DLSG quickly became the leading supplier of hybrid library products in America, helping the<br>
                most prestigious libraries across America become Digital Age Libraries.</p>
            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0818">Image Access has, by far, the largest selection of self-serve book
                scanners (KIC), the only complete<br>

                                electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the
                                electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal
                                Communications Commission.
                                The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are
                                either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured
                                in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China).
                                This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the
                                agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
