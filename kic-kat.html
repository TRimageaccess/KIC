                        For a dozen years, this shrinking student appreciation of the immense value in their
                        institution's
                        library's print collections has been a big problem that no one wants to talk about. Efforts
                        to
                        ameliorate this problem include brief mentions in freshmen orientation packets and research
                        projects
                        assigned by some faculty members, but the most common and most effective methods used to get
                        the
                        digital generation to try something different is to use lots of visuals. Just as restaurants
                        publish
                        images of their dining areas and their menu items online, with the introduction of KIC

                        View,
                        libraries can now make images of their stacks and bibliographic records available visually

                        The digital age has brought with it many changes, most desirable, some less so. When

                        enter
                        higher education, they naturally expect far greater sophistication than they experienced in

                        them, that means that everything that can be digital, should be digital. It is not obvious

                        them
                        that
                        the great value in the vast print collections in their college libraries is in the content.

                        probably
                        don't know that it's cost prohibitive to purchase a digital version of every print item.

                        spaces.
