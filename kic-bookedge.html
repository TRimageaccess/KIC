            <h2 class="block-title" id="BE-0111">Slash paper and ink costs with the innovative<br>
                KIC BookEdge self-serve scan and copy system!</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0112">The days of the photo copier on the library floor are over. Students
                demand digital, and your print collections are too valuable not to
                make them available to the majority of college students today who
                see copiers as "old school."</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0113">Occupying less space than a floor standing copier and offering
                12x17 inch book-edge scanning, KIC BookEdge provides the next
                best thing to face-up scanning in a form factor that's small enough
                to fit in the far corners of any library! And its cost is small too.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0114">But don't let its size fool you. KIC BookEdge systems provide the
                same extensive capabilities as our heavy duty KIC systems: fast
                scan/copy/fax/print, image editing and collating, save to tablets,
                smart phones, notebook PCs, USB drives, and Cloud, send via
                email or FTP.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0115">What's so special about KIC systems is how easy they are to
                use with their True2Touch interface and very large touch screens.
                Students enjoy unlimited, fast and easy access to entire library
                collections, <span class="bold">digitally</span>. It's not often that a service becomes so
                popular with students so rapidly. It's fitting that KIC systems are
                frequently purchased using student technology funds.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0201">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h2>

            <p class="block_text" id="BE-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top
                "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
                the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually
                all institutions of higher
                learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but
                since 2010 libraries have begun
                to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public
                Libraries</h2>
            <h2 id="BE-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest
                book
                scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
                provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
                scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
                KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

            <h2 id="BE-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
                they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0208">
                maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
                failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
                still. Rotating and organizing pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for
                paper copies to levels that
                make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
                use further -- to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC
                systems</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0210">also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
                scan books without damaging them.</p>

            <h2 id="BE-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy.
                Users can
                compose, review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax
                before sending. KIC's step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the
                most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0401">KIC Bookedge vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h2>
            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0402">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0403">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004,
                the days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and
                even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid ex-<br>
                plosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand
                in academic libraries for electronic copies has substantially out-<br>
                stripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for elec-<br>
                tronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0404">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet
                or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter-<br>
                net with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just
                about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In
                this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for
                three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex-<br>
                isting print collections contain vast amounts of information that
                cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to
                the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0405">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
                copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo-<br>
                copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0406">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
                to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
                major photocopier brands use a distributed
                service model.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0407">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
                because KIC has split the scan/copy
                functions into three separate machines,
                choosing the best of breed for each. As a
                result, KIC offers the best book scanners
                by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
                (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
                laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
                KIC system, so you can optimize costs
                and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

            <p id="BE-0408">ADF attachment scans<br>
                40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
                (20 sheets per minute)</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0409">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0410">With a large 11.8 X 17 inch capture area, the KIC BookEdge system
                has a maximum capture area that is 7% larger than large copiers
                and more than twice the size of typical consumer scanners. The
                image below shows the maximum scan areas of KIC products compared
                to copiers and other book scanners.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0411">KIC Bookedge Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0412">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
                a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
                spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
                has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0413">KIC BookEdge Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0414">A Five Year Comparison at a<br>
                Usage Rate of 50,000 pages per year</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0415">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC BookEdge
                system with a color copier and a black and white copier. Both
                copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0416">The costs are broken into two main areas: equipment and
                maintenance, and consumables. With KIC BookEdge, electronic
                output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the
                time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but
                is certain to rise in the future.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0417">So why is speed so important?</p>

            <ul class="peppermint" id="BE-0418">
                <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
                    or other face-down scanning machines.
                </li>
                <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
                <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
                    the copier will be used.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0419">In the digital world, there is no paper,
                toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
                images, whether black and white or color.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0420">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
                but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
                patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
                fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
                machine couldn't be justified.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0421">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
                So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
                the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
                fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
                toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
                of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0422">At a usage rate of 50,000 pages per year, these<br>
                numbers represent a five-year savings of $36,358!</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0501">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0502">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the
                bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC BookEdge easily captures content well into the bookfold
                without damaging the</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0503">spine. Black edges are automatically removed and
                the content is straightened,
                producing clean, professional looking images -
                important for electronic reserves, course curriculum
                materials and research reports. These automatic image treatment functions also
                save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0504">Compact & Affordable</h2>
            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0505">The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up
                scanning and copying in areas where space is a premium. It
                makes entire library collections available in digital form. The
                KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right
                up to the bound margin near the spine, without damaging books.
                The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no
                additional cost over black & white images! Even searchable PDF's
                and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-0506">The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the
                same space as a typical floor-standing photocopier. Replacing
                outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy
                with KIC BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive
                computerized touch screen technology. The optional ADF scanner
                and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color
                copier at a fraction of the cost.</p>

                costly expendables are avoided, even for color!
                The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0512">Charge for Prints Only...</h2>

            <p class="block_text5" id="BE-0513">or charge more for prints, less for images. When it comes to
                cost recovery, KIC systems have got you covered. KIC's fee

                color, B&W, 8.5 x 11" and 11 x 17" images.</p>

                    so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating
                    a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers
                relent- lessly
                pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany
                reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
                will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our
                window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very
                large
                touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling
                to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
                KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than
                any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful
                user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="BE-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned,
                allow- ing
                the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="BE-0616">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and
                touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's
                why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and
                equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

                motely. To better serve your patrons, it is important
                to know which KIC systems are used the most and at
                what times during the day and week, and which are
                used the least. All usage statistics can help you to de-
                termine the best KIC configuration for each site. And
                to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC system,
                KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select a particular
                KIC system via either of two methods: a map or a list.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-0904">With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the
                most stable product available today. However,
                DLSG engineers incessantly work to improve KIC

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's
                existing print collections must be available in digital
                format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty
                to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti-
                zation, providing a valuable conduit between your print
                collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and
                smart devices.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage
                your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the
                world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="BE-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each
                digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi-
                tize content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze
                more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to
                support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza-
                tion Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a
                KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network.
                When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns
                to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad-
                ministrators and faculty, simply write
                a department password file to a flash
                drive. When a user plugs in the USB
                'key', KIC recognizes the password and
                allows the user to save scanned images
                to shared folders.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impos-
                sible to affordably provide service personnel living in every city and town
                across America that are highly trained on the very special technologies
                needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG designs remote serviceability into its
                products and has perfected remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="BE-1012">The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly provide
                loaner/
                swap-out equipment and to go on site whenever necessary to maintain and repair
                equipment, minimizing interruptions in service for your patrons.</p>

            <span>A message to students</span>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13Books.png" alt="Click ClickMini Books">
            <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of which
                can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over many
                years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law, this
                knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until the books
                disintegrate.</p>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13People.png" alt="Click ClickMini  People">
            <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book scanning
                machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20 pages per
                minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce higher-quality
                digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper</p>
            <p>copiers. The images can cost as little as 1&cent;
                per page and are readable on tablets &amp; smart phones as well as notebooks and regular PCs. The images
                can
                be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard copy.</p>
            <h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
            <p>Paper copiers are as necessary as ever in administrative areas across campus, but copier companies don't
                want to give up that one place they no longer belong, the library floor.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, book spines are being damaged, paper is being wasted, and students are not seeing their
                libraries as the vast free sources for scholarly knowledge that they are.</p>

        <div class="brochure-block" id="CCM-14">
            <h3>What can be done?</h3>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Scanners.png" alt="Click ClickMini  Scanners">
                Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to inform the
                libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book scanners that can
                print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular institution. Every year,
                libraries spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet of
                new high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control ever any of that budget money. At these
                institutions, faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase
                these units. If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much
                students value getting unlimited, free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the
                effort to scape together the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Women.jpg" alt="Click ClickMini Women">
                Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student technology
                funds.). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one medium KIC
                and one large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much easier
                to justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched copier
                companies that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
            <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic copies
                replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems that scan up to
                20 pages per minute.</p>
            <span>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used?</span>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Copier.jpg" alt="Click ClickMini  Copier">
                Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used? That is
                just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital (digitize on demand),
                you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide contract with a
                copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>copiers damage books and waste paper</li>
                <li>copiers are slower than scanners</li>
                <li>digital is the future <i>(and copier companies have had digital for over 10 years!)</i></li>

                                Replacing outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC

                                The FCC Declaration of Conformity or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on
                                electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the
                                electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal
                                Communications Commission.
                                The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are
                                either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured
                                in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China).
                                This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the
                                agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
