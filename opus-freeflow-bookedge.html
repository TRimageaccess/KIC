                        The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums and
                        archives.
                        Use Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the
                        Web, and for viewing software.
                        Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and content
                        location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing
                        software.

                    <p>
                        Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the import
                        of existing images as well.
                        It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed.
                        Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.

                        With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                        treatment and outputting derivatives.
                        Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time.
                        Pages can be deleted and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted.
                        Unlimited derivatives can be created with variations in image size, resolution, format and file
                        type.

                        Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software.
                        While objects are in the middle of the Opus workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for
                        additional scanning, image modification and derivative generation.

                Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality to create digital books and
                other materials from scanned images.
                Prior to Opus, digitization had to be performed one image at a time using photo editors for image
                treatment, and content managers for keying metadata.
                With Opus Freeflow, after scanning and treating images, digital derivative images are output to
                destinations such as digital content management systems and digital master images to digital archive
                systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opus Workflow software allows for the use of temporary workers with minimal training while minimizing
                the chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards are met.
                Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow applies somewhat rigid management principles. Opus FreeFlow and Opus
                Digitization
                Workflow work seamlessly together to allow a trained digitization staff member to perform processing at
                any time and output independently of the structured workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, Opus FreeFlow works with third-party software.
                For example, if a user wishes to perform an image treatment function supported by a popular photo
                editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can launch the third-party application with the current
                image ready for editing.
                Once the edits are completed and saved, exiting the photo editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow
                with the image showing the modifications that were made.

            <p>
                Opus FreeFlow is an application that provides the scanning, image treatment and derivative creation
                capabilities of the full Opus Digitization Workflow system outside of its structured project management
                environment.
                Opus FreeFlow doesn't capture or output metadata or perform automatic archiving.
                Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software.
                While objects are in the middle of the Opus Workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow and
                additional scanning performed, images modified and derivatives created.

                                They absolutely demand digital technology as an integral part of their library
                                experience.
                                KIC self-serve scanning systems make your entire library collection accessible in

                                It's simple two-button interface makes it very approachable, even by technically timid
                                students.
                                It's low price, sleek design, and small 2x2' foot print make KIC BookEdge a very
                                practical entry-level self-serve scanning solution for any library.

                                The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up scanning and copying in areas
                                where space is a premium.
                                It makes entire library collections available in digital form.
                                The KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin
                                near the spine, without damaging books.
                                The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost over black
                                &amp; white images!
                                Even searchable PDF's and text-to-speech (MP3 files) are a snap to create.

                                The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical
                                floor-standing photocopier.
                                Replacing outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC
                                BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen
                                technology.
                                With the addition of a color laser printer, the KIC BookEdge provides the functionality
                                of a color copier at a fraction of the cost.

                                The FCC Declaration of Conformity or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on
                                electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the
                                electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal
                                Communications Commission.
                                The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are
                                either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured
                                in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China).
                                This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the
                                agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
