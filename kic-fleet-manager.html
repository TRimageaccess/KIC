                remotely. To better serve your patrons,
                it is important to know which KIC systems are
                used the most and at what times during the
                day and week, and which are used the least.
                All usage statistics can help you to determine
                the best KIC configuration for each site. And
                to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC
                system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select
                a particular KIC system via either of two
                methods: a map or a list. </p>

                With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
                work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and
                in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager
                lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and
                off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.
