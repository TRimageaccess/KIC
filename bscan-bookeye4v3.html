            <h2 class="block-title-sub" id="ILL-0104">... better image quality, fewer errors, and easier operation</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0105">In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital
                document delivery, the available software was simple and
                image quality expectations of requestors were low. Times
                have changed. The demand for faster workflow delivery and
                perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software
                environment complex, creating significant challenges in
                training new employees. BSCAN ILL simplifies existing
                processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0106">BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter
                requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the
                information that is required by interlibrary loan document de-
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0107">livery software from
                scanned pull slips, not
                only saving time but also
                eliminating human error.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0108">Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed
                face-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2
                & V1. By eliminating the constant book flipping required
                by flatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to
                five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and
                they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume
                ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge flatbed
                scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster
                mode that scans two pages at a time.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0109">Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL's powerful image
                treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and
                remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.
            </p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0110">Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through
                ILLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange,
                Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notify ILLiad/Odyssey
                in each case, all without any need for further human
                intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.

            <h1 class="block-title" id="ILL-0210">BSCAN ILL<br>
                Dramatically Improves ILL Digitization</h1>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0211">A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
                research community together is open sharing of newfound
                knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
                pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
                Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent
                on their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0212">In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
                had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment
                to meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document
                delivery software and there were no scanners made
                specifically for scanning books, journals and maps. Over
                time, that changed. Planetary scanners became available in
                the late 1990s. The first release of BSCAN ILL automatically
                read (using OCR) the requestor information from pull slips
                without manual keying, supported rapid scanning and image
                cleanup, and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a
                single button. Since then, ILLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
                and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN ILL
                with the same hands-off automation. BSCAN ILL has a host
                of valuable features, many of which are not available with any
                other system.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0213">In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource
                sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival,
                electronic course materials creation, scanning projects), only

                book mode (one page at a time), this scanner flattens the page
                and captures deep into the fold of tightly bound journals. With
                BSCAN ILL, the BookEdge can also be used to scan 2 pages
                at a time, which is substantially faster than book mode. BSCAN

            <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0703">The exceptional image quality produced by Bookeye and

                ing with Archivists as well as use for projects and creat-<br>
                ing digital course materials. Reduce your cost per article

                without the additional cost of color copiers or color micro-

                equipment. A complementary schedule<br>
                is usually easy to agree upon. Note that while the<br>

                size (17x25'') images of any face-up scanner today</h3>

            <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0709">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
                which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. Afford-<br>
                able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels
                must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which
                can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0710">Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ
                linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels.
                Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

            <p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0711">Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-<br>

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0712">Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror
                system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the corners of the
                image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also
                scan in V-mode or flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the

            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0815">Our experience in digitization of printed materials dates back to 1988
                prior to its founding<br>
                in 1993, when Image Access began providing digitization workflow solutions to commercial<br>
                markets. Having developed its own book and wide format scanners as well as its own OCR,<br>
                barcode reading and image treatment algorithms and a powerful workflow system, Image Access<br>
                is well-equipped to meet both general and specialized digitization needs.</p>
            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0816">Image Access has a long history of leadership in digital technology.
                Image Access created Scan2Net&reg;,<br>
                the first Ethernet/HTML based scanner interface, the first self-serve book scanner kiosk, the first
                and<br>
                only ILL scan, clean-up and delivery workflow system, the first affordable preservation quality
                large<br>
                format planetary scanner, the first affordable duplex newspaper scanner, the first and only book scanner<br>
                with both flat and v-modes, the first and only complete digitization workflow system, and more. We
                also<br>
                have the most extensive and prestigious customer list for book scanners in the United States and
                many<br>
                countries abroad.</p>
            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0817">Image Access created the Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) in 2004
                to focus on the special needs<br>
                of academic, research and public libraries. And just as Bookeye quickly became the leading book<br>
                scanner, DLSG quickly became the leading supplier of hybrid library products in America, helping the<br>
                most prestigious libraries across America become Digital Age Libraries.</p>
            <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0818">Image Access has, by far, the largest selection of self-serve book

                                With this new member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on
                                developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced;
                                to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users.
                                The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 digitizes source material such as bound documents at
                                high speeds in up to 400 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A3.

                                Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the
                                creation and manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4 models.
                                The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether
                                it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
                            </p>

                                The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and
                                binding during digitization.
                                The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees;
                                enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original
                                subject matter.

                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device.
                                Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 can reach
                                unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external
                                peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.

                                It takes approximately 1.1 seconds for the Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 to capture and process the
                                images of two pages of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution.
                                Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as
                                brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan.
                                Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands
                                on the touchscreen.
                                Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive, sent via email, printed on a connected
                                or network printer, or uploaded to an FTP Server or Cloud.

                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V3's solid build, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an
                                ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library.
                                Some of the advantages of using a Bookeye&reg; 4 instead of a standard copier include
                                the Bookeye&reg;'s built-in book cradle for gently handling bound materials, its speed
                                and
                                simplicity of operation, and the fact that the resulting digital images substantially
                                reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to print scanned material.

                            scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful your
                            computer is. We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops.
                            We're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are
                            dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer
                            rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation
                            at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2
                            Gigabit or less).

                purchase a second one! - University of Alaska </p>
            <p id="QID61"> ........ KIC is AWESOME!" - University of Oregon .......... We LOVE our KIC book scan
                stations! - University of Iowa </p>
            <p id="QID62"> ........ The KIC interface seems to be better designed based on staff and student comments. -
                Texas A&M </p>
            <p id="QID63"> ........ Love the KIC scanner. NO need for a photocopier! - University of Pennsylvania</p>
            <p id="QID64"> ........ We love you KIC scanners AND so do our STUDENTS! Thanks! - Missouri, Columbia </p>
            <p id="QID65"> ........ We love our KIC system, it is so much cooler than the Ivina. KIC looks like it is
                from the 21st century, the other one looks like it is from a hundred years ago. Also we love the fact
                that you can export as an MP3 in KIC. - Millersville University of Pennsylvania </p>
            <p id="QID66"> ........ KIC makes my research so much more accessible! Thank ya! - Duke University</p>
            <p id="QID67"> ........ Students love the KIC, they are always using it. You would think that with all the
                other technology our library has, that students would use them. No, instead they say 'You guys have a
                KIC!! That is so Cool!' - Miami University of Ohio </p>
            <p id="QID68"> ........ Without a doubt, the KIC BookEdge is a great machine. But the service we
                received...is what made the sale. - St. Mary's College of Maryland </p>
            <p id="QID69"> ........ People love the KIC Bookeye 4 scanner, they love using the cradles. - Columbia Law
                School </p>
            <p id="QID70"> ........ Our administrators have noted that photocopier activity has gone down in the past
                years, and they are attributing that to KIC ... the quality of the scans are excellent ... The Bookeyes
                are amazing scanners. - University of Texas </p>
            <p id="QID71"> ........ The opportunities created for NSU students to enhance their studies and course
                materials will be unmatched by most institutions of comparable size---and by many that are much larger!
                - Northwestern State University </p>
            <p id="QID72"> ........ Each time I've had the opportunity to introduce a new student to this service, the
