                        Most libraries have a lot of volumes that haven't been checked out in a long time, and libraries
                        certainly can increase their relevance in the digital age by adding collaboration and study
                        spaces.
                        So it is rather compelling to cull books from the library.

                        argument to ignore. However, relevance in the digital age is not easily pursued without

                        The main argument against culling/moving books off-site is the unknown, but potentially great
                        value
                        that your unabridged collection can have in inciting the very uncommon, but equally special
                        epiphany
                        that a researcher can have while browsing the stacks and perusing the very books that are

                        browsable, then before you proceed with the culling, let DLSG photograph your entire collection

                        another touch, read books that have been digitized.
