                KIC is an indispensable study and research tool that enhances reports and papers with crystal clear
                color and black &amp; white pictures, graphs, and excerpts from books, magazines and journals.
                In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC
                can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Preservation, Archive and Interlibrary Loan
                departments.

<h3 class="mint">No More Book Spine Damage</h3>
<p>
Face-up KIC systems scan book pages "two-up", analyze the single image, and automatically split the image into two separate images - all in one step that takes just 5 seconds.
The KIC BookEdge captures one page at-a-time without damage to book spines.
Minimizing book spine damage is especially important because, unlike digital content that can be loaned a limited number of times, excerpts of printed books can be scanned an unlimited number of times.
This is why self-serve scanning systems dramatically increases the value of your existing print collections.
</p>
<div class="two-col">
<div class="left-col">
<p>
In addition to splitting two-up images into individual pages and rotating page images to their proper orientation, the black edges are automatically removed and the content straightened, producing clean, professional looking images.
This is especially important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports.
These automatic image treatment functions also save time for faculty and administrators.

            <p>
                The face-up scanning capability of KIC Bookeye 4 and KIC Click&trade; systems enables users to capture
                multiple pages far more easily than ever before -
                books no longer need to be flipped over to turn the page and then flipped back over for each scan or
                copy.
                KIC systems scan up to ten times faster than a typical flatbed scanner and over twice as fast as a high
                speed copier.
                In addition, it produces either color or black &amp; white images for the same cost, which equates to
                substantial savings.
                Finally, KIC promotes a cleaner environment by reducing paper and toner use.

                        The "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons occupy a very large portion of the 17" touch

                        The "Save" button defaults to an output method that is selectable by the institution.
                        If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it
                        will save to the flash drive.
                        Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of
                        output.

                To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's print collections must be available in

                KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve

                KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets.
                Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email, dramatically

                        can scan just about anything: from business cards to diagrams in A2 format, books, newspapers, maps, bound documents and more. The scanner needs only three seconds to scan the largest format.<

                        st century, the other one looks like it is from a hundred years ago. Also we love the fact that you can export as an MP3 in KIC.
