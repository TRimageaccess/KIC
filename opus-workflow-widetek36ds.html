    <meta name="description" content="The WideTEK 36 DS is the world's first wide format scanner for duplex digitization of newspapers and other double-sided printed documents up to 36 inches (915 mm) in width. This compact device needs only four seconds to scan the front and back sides of a newspaper page (at 300 dpi). The idea of double-sided scanning in one production step primarily means less production effort: The document no longer needs to be flipped over and scanned again on the other side. That makes the scanner an ideal companion for press clipping, archiving and library services.">

                        Get into the game with Opus! Long have the complexity and high startup and operating costs of
                        digitization
                        projects kept most libraries, museums and archives on the sidelines. Opus leverages today's
                        high-performance,
                        low-cost computers to obliterate those barriers with its paint-by-numbers digitization system
                        that produces the highest quality digital collections possible at less than 1/3 historic startup
                        and operating
                        costs. In as little as one day, Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) installation and training
                        staff will leave
                        you with a fully operational digitization system. Followon training sessions via the Web ensure
                        that your staff
                        is producing multiple beautiful digital books per day in no time, complete with hierarchical
                        metadata.

                    <p>
                        With the new low prices and high-performance of the latest book scanning hardware, complete
                        digitization labs are surprisingly affordable.

                        Compose
                        Collection and Create Collection capabilities, Opus can create an unlimited number of digital
                        collections
                        in nearly unlimited formats (derivatives) any time in the future. Simply select the desired
                        volumes and
                        data formats and let Opus create your collection(s) unattended overnight.

                    <p>
                        Opus' automated data migration facility makes it easy to transfer multiple copies of your
                        digital archive to
                        new media every three to five years, ensuring that no data is ever lost. In addition, during
                        data migration,
                        Opus will automatically convert from outdated data formats to any new standards that might
                        emerge in the future.

                    into the Opus digitization workflow system. The Opus Metadata
                    Capture stages allow users to select from a list of standard
                    hierarchical metadata templates, create new ones and restrict
                    users to a subset of templates for a given project. The templates
                    include metadata characteristics like requiring certain metadata
                    to be captured, allowing some types of metadata to be repeated
                    and requiring a single value for other types.

                    process, there are three points at which archival is necessary:
                    1) archival of images immediately after scanning and before
                    image treatment is performed; 2) archival of images after image

                    and before the media or data formats become obsolete. Opus'

                    to new media, it can convert images and/or metadata from its
                    existing standardized formats to new standardized formats,

                <p class="block_text" id="WF-0319">The Opus architecture originates from a clear understanding
                    of the core purposes of each element of digitization and
                    access systems. In the book publishing business, rarely are
                    books manufactured in the stores that sell them. Not only is
                    manufacturing separate from retail, but distributors exist to
                    attend to the specific needs of each of their stores while providing
                    a simple, consolidated relationship with book manufacturers.
                    In some cases, distributors provide warehousing services
                    and in other cases, product warehousing is performed by the
                    manufacturer. Opus serves as the manufacturer, warehouse
                    and distributor.

            <div>
                <p class="block_text" id="WF-0502">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that
                    can be created and modified to fit virtually any
                    requirements. Input field characteristics include: required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only
                    and other characteristics
                    that can be specified when templates are constructed or modified. Opus provides several generic
                    templates to capture the
                    data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>

                <p class="block_text" id="WF-0503">Opus provides a
                    straightforward graphical interface for creating and
                    modifying hierarchical templates. The templates
                    carry the characteristics of XML elements and
                    attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional
                    and single/multiple can be assigned to each field.
                    During metadata capture and entry, Opus enforces
                    the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and
                    reducing the possibility of errors.</p>

                <p class="block_text" id="WF-0504">In addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows a
                    user to scroll back and forth through the images of
                    an object (e.g. pages of a book) while reviewing and entering metadata.</p>

                                The WideTEK 36 DS is the world's first wide format scanner for duplex digitization of
                                newspapers and other double-sided printed documents up to 36 inches (915 mm) in width.
                                This compact device needs only four seconds to scan the front and back sides of a
                                newspaper page (at 300 dpi).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The idea of double-sided scanning in one production step primarily means less production
                                effort:
                                The document no longer needs to be flipped over and scanned again on the other side.
                                That makes the scanner an ideal companion for press clipping, archiving and library
                                services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scanner features two camera boxes, both consisting of three CCD systems, integrated
                                into the upper and lower part of the device - only a few inches from each other.
                                The WideTEK 36 DS captures both sides of the newspaper at the same time. After scanning,
                                software separates the scanned document into four single images;
                                capturing the left and right sides on the front and back of the newspaper - all in a
                                single step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scanner is equipped with two processor units.
                                This allows an extremely fast data throughput.
                                The patented stitching procedure and the optical resolution of 1200 x 600 dpi guarantee
                                brilliant scan results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mechanical construction of the WideTEK 36 DS is also a highlight.
                                The more extensive mechanics and additional camera and light units were integrated into
                                the device without dramatically enlarging its dimensions.
                                The duplex scanner is only 13 centimetres larger than the compact WideTEK 36.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The complete camera optical system is integrated in a hermetically sealed housing.
                                Once optimally adjusted, it remains stable, dust-free and requires virtually no
                                maintenance.

                                The FCC Declaration of Conformity or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on
                                electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the
                                electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal
                                Communications Commission.
                                The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are
                                either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured
                                in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China).
                                This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the
                                agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
