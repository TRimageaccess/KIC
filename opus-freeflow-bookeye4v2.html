                        The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums and
                        archives.
                        Use Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the
                        Web, and for viewing software.
                        Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and content
                        location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing
                        software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the import
                        of existing images as well.
                        It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed.
                        Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.

                        With Opus FreeFlow 4-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                        treatment and outputting derivatives.
                        Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time.
                        Pages can be deleted and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted.
                        Unlimited derivatives can be created with variations in image size, resolution, format and file
                        type.

                        Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software.
                        While objects are in the middle of the Opus workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for
                        additional scanning, image modification and derivative generation.

                    <p>Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
                        on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
                        which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
                        via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
                        and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
                        freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
                        make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
                        For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
                        Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>

                        resources can be uploaded to a DLSG-maintained archive repository as part of the OAI publishing

                <p class="OAI5">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
                    and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
                    :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristics
                    that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
                    generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>
                <div class="block_hierarchical_metadata">
                    <p class="block_hierarchical_metadata_table">Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for
                        creating and modifying hierarchical templates. The templates carry the characteristics
                        of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
                        single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
                        Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>

                        <p>One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
                            is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
                            their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
                            sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
                            task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
                            know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
                            team.</p>
                        <p>Once these completed metadata collection templates have
                            been defined , they can be shared back into the curator's community,
                            thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
                            that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
                            into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
                            publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>

                <p>Unlike Opus Workflow, Opus FleeFlow
                    doesn't perform automatic archiving or manage workflow.

                    digitization software. They can be used independently or together.
                    For example, while objects are in the middle of the Opus Workflow,

                    Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality
                    to create digital books and other materials from scanned images. Prior to Opus,
                    digitization had to be performed one image at a time using photos editors for image
                    treatment, and content managers for keying metadata. With Opus FreeFlow, after scanning
                    and treating images, digital derivative images are output to destinations such as digital
                    content management systems, and digital master images to digital archive systems.<br><br>
                    Opus Digitization Workflow software allows for the use temporary workers with minimal
                    training while minimizing the chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards
                    are met. Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow applies somewhat rigid managements principles.
                    Opus FreeFlow and Opus Digitization Workflow work seamlessly together and can be used by a
                    trained digitization staff member at any time to perform processing and output independently
                    of Opus Workflow.

                <p class="infoblock__opus-freeflow-features-textblock-part2">
                    Opus FreeFlow also works with third-party software. For example, if a user wishes to perform an image
                    treatment
                    function supported by a popular photo editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can launch the
                    third-party
                    application with the current image ready for editing. Once the edits are completed and saved, exiting
                    the photo
                    editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow with the image showing the modifications that were made.

                            <p>
                                With this latest member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on
                                developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced;
                                to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users.
                                The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 digitizes source material such as bound documents at high
                                speeds in up to 600 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A2.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the
                                creation and manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4.
                                The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether
                                it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and
                                binding during digitization.
                                The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees;
                                enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original
                                subject matter.
                            </p>

                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V2 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device.
                                Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye&reg; 4 can reach
                                unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external
                                peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It takes approximately 1.6 seconds for the Bookeye&reg; 4 to capture and process the
                                images of two pages of a DIN A2 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution.
                                Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as
                                brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan.
                                Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well-structured menu commands
                                on the touchscreen.
                                Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive or Cloud, sent via email, printed on a
                                connected or network printer, or uploaded to an FTP Server.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bookeye&reg; 4 V2's solid build, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an
                                ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library.
                                Some of the advantages of using a Bookeye&reg; 4 instead of a standard copier include
                                the Bookeye&reg;'s built-in book cradle for gently handling bound materials, its speed
                                and simplicity of operation, and the fact that the resulting digital images
                                substantially reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to print scanned material.

                from the 21st century, the other one looks like it is from a hundred years ago. Also we love the fact
                that you can export as an MP3 in KIC. - Millersville University of Pennsylvania </p>
            <p id="QID66"> ........ KIC makes my research so much more accessible! Thank ya! - Duke University</p>
            <p id="QID67"> ........ Students love the KIC, they are always using it. You would think that with all the
                other technology our library has, that students would use them. No, instead they say 'You guys have a
                KIC!! That is so Cool!' - Miami University of Ohio </p>
            <p id="QID68"> ........ Without a doubt, the KIC BookEdge is a great machine. But the service we
                received...is what made the sale. - St. Mary's College of Maryland </p>
            <p id="QID69"> ........ People love the KIC Bookeye 4 scanner, they love using the cradles. - Columbia Law
                School </p>
            <p id="QID70"> ........ Our administrators have noted that photocopier activity has gone down in the past
                years, and they are attributing that to KIC ... the quality of the scans are excellent ... The Bookeyes
                are amazing scanners. - University of Texas </p>
            <p id="QID71"> ........ The opportunities created for NSU students to enhance their studies and course
                materials will be unmatched by most institutions of comparable size---and by many that are much larger!
                - Northwestern State University </p>
            <p id="QID72"> ........ Each time I've had the opportunity to introduce a new student to this service, the
                response has generally been surprise and delight. - University of Washington </p>
