                        The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums and
                        archives.
                        Use Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the
                        Web, and for viewing software.
                        Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and content
                        location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing
                        software.

                    <p>
                        Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the import
                        of existing images as well.
                        It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed.
                        Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.

                        With Opus FreeFlow 4-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                        treatment and outputting derivatives.
                        Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time.
                        Pages can be deleted and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted.
                        Unlimited derivatives can be created with variations in image size, resolution, format and file
                        type.

                        Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software.
                        While objects are in the middle of the Opus workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for
                        additional scanning, image modification and derivative generation.

                    <p>Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
                        on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
                        which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
                        via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
                        and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
                        freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
                        make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
                        For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
                        Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>

                        metadata export may either be hosted by the OPUS customers themselves or the
                        resources can be uploaded to a DLSG-maintained archive repository as part of the OAI publishing
                        process.
                    </p>
                    <p>Published objects can be further queried and made available
                        by Opus's support for the OAI-ORE project. In addition to the cloud based OAI
                        publishing features, the DLSG cloud repository allows the user community of
                        Opus Systems to share or exchange Opus objects among themselves.</p>

                <p class="OAI5">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
                    and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
                    :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristics
                    that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
                    generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>

                        of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
                        single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
                        Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>

                        <p>One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
                            is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
                            their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
                            sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
                            task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
                            know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
                            team.</p>
                        <p>Once these completed metadata collection templates have
                            been defined , they can be shared back into the curator's community,
                            thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
                            that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
                            into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
                            publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>

                <p>Opus FreeFlow is an application that provides the scanning, image treatment and

                    capabilities of the full Opus Digitization Workflow system outside of its structured project management

                <p>Unlike Opus Workflow, Opus FleeFlow
                    doesn't perform automatic archiving or manage workflow.
                    Opus FreeFlow is also fully compatible with Opus Workflow
                    digitization software. They can be used independently or together.
                    For example, while objects are in the middle of the Opus Workflow,
                    they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for additional scanning,
                    image modification and creation of derivatives.</p>

                    Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality
                    to create digital books and other materials from scanned images. Prior to Opus,
                    digitization had to be performed one image at a time using photos editors for image
                    treatment, and content managers for keying metadata. With Opus FreeFlow, after scanning
                    and treating images, digital derivative images are output to destinations such as digital
                    content management systems, and digital master images to digital archive systems.<br><br>
                    Opus Digitization Workflow software allows for the use temporary workers with minimal
                    training while minimizing the chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards
                    are met. Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow applies somewhat rigid managements principles.
                    Opus FreeFlow and Opus Digitization Workflow work seamlessly together and can be used by a
                    trained digitization staff member at any time to perform processing and output independently
                    of Opus Workflow.

                    Opus FreeFlow also works with third-party software. For example, if a user wishes to perform an image
                    treatment
                    function supported by a popular photo editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can launch the
                    third-party
                    application with the current image ready for editing. Once the edits are completed and saved, exiting
                    the photo
                    editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow with the image showing the modifications that were made.

                                It makes entire library collections available in digital form.
                                The KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin
                                near the spine, without damaging books.
                                The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost over black
                                &amp; white images!

                                The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical
                                floor-standing photocopier.
                                Replacing outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC
                                BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen
                                technology.
                                With the addition of a color laser printer, the KIC BookEdge provides the functionality
                                of a color copier at a fraction of the cost.

                                The FCC Declaration of Conformity or the FCC mark is a certification mark employed on
                                electronic products manufactured or sold in the United States which certifies that the
                                electromagnetic interference from the device is under limits approved by the Federal
                                Communications Commission.
                                The FCC label is found even on products sold outside the US territory, because they are
                                either products manufactured in the US and had been exported, or they were manufactured
                                in other nations which have US as a prime market (eg: Japan, China).
                                This makes the FCC label recognizable worldwide even to people to whom the name of the
                                agency Federal Communications Commission is not familiar.
