 <h2 class="product-tab mint">Click&trade; - developed specifically for the self-service market</h2>
 <div class="product-tab">  
  <p>
   When people see the new KIC Click&trade; for the first time, the most common expression is "it's so beautiful."  
   And with True2Touch, it's as easy to use as it is beautiful. 
   Are there any compromises? You decide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The KIC Click&trade; captures book content as fast as 1 page per second! 
   With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 21x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. 
   The smooth, triple-layer, pearlescent white KIC Click&trade; totally reverses that trend. 
   It adds beauty to the most beautiful libraries. 
   Inspired by an outstanding effort of the fledgling tablet industry to turn technology into something more like jewelry or a fashion accessory than a computer, the pearlescent KIC Click&trade; evokes comments like, "We care about the appearance of our library and this machine is over the top!"
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="product-tab">  
  <p>
   The KIC Click&trade; perfectly completes the KIC family of self-serve digitizing systems. 
   The KIC Bookeye 4 has the most durable production book scanner, the only book scanner with both V-cradle and flat modes, and the highest quality 600dpi of any scanner. 
   The KIC Click&trade; is small, fast and beautiful, and the KIC BookEdge is cheaper than most floor standing black-and-white photocopiers. 
   And since none of them use toner or paper, they're environmentally friendly and ultimately far cheaper to run than copiers.
  </p>
 </div>
</div><div ID="All-In-One_Features"> 

<h2 class="product-tab mint">Key Features of Click&trade; </H2>

<div class="product-tab"><p>
The Click&trade;'s sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a mere 25 inch width.
It's large, 23 inch touch screen and capture surface are at the perfect heights when placed on a typical table or desktop. 
The Click&trade; also has an optional matching stand for freestanding operation.
</p></div>

<div class="product-tab"><ul>
<li>Digitize / copy up to 16x21 inch pages in full color</li>
<li>Create full color electronic images and/or paper copies with just two touches</li>
<li>Review large electronic images before saving or printing copies</li>
<li>Electronically collate and print copies on a standard laser printer</li>
<li>Create searchable PDF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG and editable text files</li>
<li>Create audio files from text for MP3 players, including iPods</li>
<li>Go 'green'. Promote minimal use of paper and ink.</li>
<li>Charge for prints, not for images</li>
<li>Output to USB devices, email, file servers, the Web &amp; printers</li>
<li>Minimize book spine damage with face-up scanning</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="product-tab"><p>
Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, the KIC Click&trade; allows users to digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press them hard against a glass plate. 
The Click&trade;'s lightening speed is derived as much from its fast opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the digitization process.
</p></div>

<div class="product-tab"><p>
The Click&trade; produces beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost over black &amp; white images! 
Searchable PDF's and editable text files are a snap to create. 
As with all KIC self-serve systems, the Click&trade;'s text-to-speech capability produces audio files that can be played in any MP3 player. 
Studying and research have never been so easy!
