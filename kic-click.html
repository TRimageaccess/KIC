            <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0104">The KIC Click is a high-speed, face-up book capture system
                at an affordable price. Its sleek and elegant look will
                complement any library floor. And with its True2Touch<span class="superscript2">TM</span> user
                interface, KIC Click is as easy to use as it is beautiful. Are
                there any compromises? You decide.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0105">The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for
                instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy
                transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size 30%
                larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 22 x16
                inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of
                300dpi.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0106">Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise
                beautiful libraries across America. The smooth but rugged black
                or white KIC Clicks totally reverse that trend, adding beauty
                to even the most beautiful libraries.</p>

            <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top
                "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
                the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually
                all institutions of higher
                learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but
                since 2010 libraries have begun
                to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public
                Libraries</h1>
            <h2 id="CCM-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest
                book
                scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
                provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
                scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
                KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

            <h2 id="CCM-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
                they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0208">
                maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
                failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
                still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier
                than shuffling paper.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for
                paper copies to levels that
                make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
                use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
                scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
                mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

            <h2 id="CCM-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy.
                Users can compose,
                review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's
                step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is
                an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for
                the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

            <h2 id="CCM-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally
                must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method
                of charging users for copies and faxes.</p>
            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins"
                on regular letter-sized paper in any
                denomination that you like, cut them
                out, and sell them to users at the
                circulation desk or wherever you
                collect fees for late book returns.</p>

            <h2 id="CCM-0216">KIC Compatible with Copy Card & Cash Systems</h2>
            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0217">All KIC systems are compatible with all
                standard copy card and coin-op devices.
                Since KIC transfers images to users' computers
                electronically, costly expendables
                are avoided, even for color! The library
                can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

                Click gets deep into the bookfold of tightly-bound volumes
                by capturing from two angles, and easily straightens out the
                worst curves, producing clear, professional quality images.</p>

                scanners. It handles a large percentage of books that are too big
                for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time
                without damage to their spines.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0507">KIC Click's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
                true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
                need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0508">KIC Click's sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve

                If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will
                save to the

            <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cell-
                phone makers relentlessly pursued smaller and smaller
                screens until very recently when one company reversed that
                trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
                will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis-
                play screens are our window to the digital world, and touch
                screens give us control over that world.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense
                to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices
                for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate
                display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
                KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more
                experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most under-
                standable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-
                serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what
                you've scanned, allowing the touch screen to have big, easy
                to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

            <p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0616">Display screens are our portals into the
                digital world, and touch screens are the
                easiest way to control that world. That's
                why DLSG provides large, 24 inch,<br>
                full HD displays and equally large touch
                screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to a library in 2004, the days
                of photocopiers for patron use in libraries were numbered. And
                now with the rapid explosion of tablet computers and electronic
                readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies
                has substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The
                demand for electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a
                tipping point.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0804">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet
                or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter- net
                with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just
                about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In
                this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for
                three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex- isting
                print collections contain vast amounts of information that
                cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to
                the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
                copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- copies
                high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
                to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
                major photocopier brands use a distributed
                service model.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
                because KIC has split the scan/copy
                functions into three separate machines,
                choosing the best of breed for each. As a
                result, KIC offers the best book scanners
                by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
                (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
                laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
                KIC system, so you can optimize costs
                and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

            <p id="CCM-0808">ADF attachment scans<br>
                40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
                (20 sheets per minute)</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0809">Click vs. Copiers</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Click system with
                two color copiers and with two black and white copiers. Both copiers are
                the kinds typically seen in academic libraries. One KIC Click is compared
                with two copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two times
                the performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0811">areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables,
                and patron usage time. With KIC Click, electronic output
                is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the
                time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in
                2012, but is certain to rise in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

            <p class="block_text8" id="CCM-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into
                the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Click
                easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

            <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0814">KIC automatically removes black<br>
                edges, straightens content, and<br>
                produces clean, professional look-<br>

                tronic reserves, course curriculum<br>

            <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0826">These automatic image treatment<br>
                functions also save a lot of admin-<br>
                istrator, faculty, and student time.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

            <p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0816">KIC Click & Click Mini handle thick books beautifully. Their<br>
                contour-finding lasers allow it to flatten even the most curved<br>
                books and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC<br>
                automatically adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0817">Click Mini Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America re-
                vealed
                a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
                spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
                has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

            <ul class="peppermint" id="CCM-0820">
                <li>It's economical. One Click can replace multiple copiers
                    or other face-down scanning machines.
                </li>
                <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
                <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
                    the copier will be used.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0821">In the digital world,
                there is no paper,
                toner or ink, so li- braries
                rarely charge
                for images, whether
                black and white or
                color.</p>

            <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with
                color copiers, but could never find a formula that
                worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy
                materials with so much color that the library would
                spend more on ink than the fees they were col- lecting.
                If the fees were too high, the usage would
                be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be
                justified.</p>

            <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image
                before it is printed. So the fee for copies with a
                little bit of color can be the same as the fee for
                black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color,
                the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost
                of the color ink or toner. This wonderful feature
                should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital
                age, and it is with KIC.</p>

            <h3 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and
                books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Click, Click Mini and
                other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see
                what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates
                the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning
                pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that facedown
                scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of faceup
                systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book
                on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in
                the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                and the patron.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning sytems
                involves only the basic movement required to set a book

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0919">Control,update and monitor your KIC systems remotely. To
                better serve your patrons, it is important to know which KIC
                systems are used the most and at what times during the
                day and week, and which are used the least. All usage statistics
                can help you to determine the best KIC configuration
                for each site. And to make it easier to navigate from KIC to
                KIC system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select a particular
                KIC system via either of two methods: a map or a list.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0920">With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
                work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                digital world. DLSG offers improved software re-</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0921">gularly, and in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet
                Manager lets you
                update KIC systems remotely. For example, a recently released feature
                lets you turn KIC systems on and off on demand or on a schedule set by a
                central control panel.</p>

            <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1001">The Hybrid Library</h1>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's
                existing print collections must be available in digital
                format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty
                to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti- zation,
                providing a valuable conduit between your print
                collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and
                smart devices.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage
                your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the
                world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

            <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each
                digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize
                content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze
                more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to
                support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza- tion
                Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a
                KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network.
                When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns
                to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators
                and faculty, simply write
                a department password file to a flash
                drive. When a user plugs in the USB
                'key', KIC recognizes the password and
                allows the user to save scanned images
                to shared folders.</p>

            <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impos-
                sible
                to affordably provide service personnel living in every city and town
                across America that are highly trained on the very special technologies
                needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG designs remote serviceability into its
                products and has perfected remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

            <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1012">The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly provide
                loaner/swap-out
                equipment and to go on site whenever necessary to maintain and repair equipment,
                minimizing interruptions in service for your patrons.</p>

                                common expression is "it's so beautiful."
                                And with True2Touch, it's as easy to use as it is beautiful. Our new and exciting Click
                                Mini book scanner achieves a far more affordable
                                price point for face-up book scanning than ever before. Are there any compromises? You

                                The KIC Click&trade; captures book content as fast as 1 page per second!
                                With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 21x16 inch
                                books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.

                                access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and
                                servers. Its 12.25 x 19.2 inch bed size
                                is significantly larger than double-letter and is large enough for most book pages. Very

                                page at a time sideways and the images rotated. And of course, it handles loose paper
                                and other flat material, too.

                                It adds beauty to the most beautiful libraries.
                                Inspired by an outstanding effort of the fledgling tablet industry to turn technology
                                into something more like jewelry or a fashion accessory than a computer, the pearlescent

                                The KIC Bookeye 4 has the most durable production book scanner, the only book scanner
                                with both V-cradle and flat modes, and the highest quality 600dpi of any scanner.
                                The KIC Clicks are small, fast and beautiful, and the KIC BookEdge is cheaper than most
                                floor standing black-and-white photocopiers.
                                And since none of them use toner or paper, they're environmentally friendly and
                                ultimately far cheaper to run than copiers.

                            Both Click&trade; and Click Mini also have an optional matching stand for freestanding
                            operation. The optional KIC SmartDock feature can transfer 10-20 full-color pages
                            per second directly to any smart device.

                            Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, both KIC Click&trade; and Click Mini allow users to
                            digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press them hard against a glass
                            plate.
                            The Click&trade;'s / Click Mini's lightening speed is derived as much from its fast
                            opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the need to flip books
                            over and over again during the digitization process.
                        </p></div>

                            The Click&trade; and Click Mini produce beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost
                            over black &amp; white images!
                            Searchable PDF's and editable text files are a snap to create.
                            As with all KIC self-serve systems, scanner's text-to-speech capability produces audio files
                            that can be played in any MP3 player.
