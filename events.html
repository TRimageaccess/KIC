                        <p>The Flagler Museum was recently awarded several generous grants that will significantly
                            impact its ability to
                            preserve and interpret its collections.</p>

                            Beach County), and The Fortin Foundation of Florida have all provided funding to support the
                            Museum’s
                            purchase of the specialized Bookeye 4 V1A Professional Scanner. This high resolution machine
                            can scan
                            fragile books and documents from the Museum’s collections while safely holding them in place
                            in a special
                            cradle. The specialized scanner will allow the Museum to greatly enhance its collections
                            research and
                            interpretation capabilities while meeting professional collections care standards.</p>

                            The system has an advantage of software upgrades to add color and to increase resolution to
                            up to 600dpi in the future.</p>

                            "The Bookeye 4 scanning machine is uniquely capable of integrating with our current software
                            systems for request automation, and will enable us to create higher-quality black-and-white,
                            grayscale, and color scans than currently possible with the older machines. This newer model
                            uses a "V" cradle A2 linear CCD planetary overhead book scanner, which allows the book to be
                            scanned at a perfect 120&deg; angle protecting the book spine and binding.
                            Image output is the equivalent of a 125 megapixel camera in black and white and a 425
                            megapixel camera in color.
                            This model will increase our turnaround time, and provide students with faster remote access
                            to library materials to use in their coursework and research, thus freeing their time to
                            focus on their research, rather than on scanners or photocopy machines.
                            The lens is kept in alignment with the book which results in highly precise scans,
                            regardless of whether the material is flat or bound." </p>

                            Google is cutting back dramatically on their book digitization efforts while ramping up
                            their usage of individuals' data to create more focused advertising and online browsing.
                            Legal battles over their plan to acquire 'all knowledge' may have soured them.
                            Although Google was able to digitize the bulk of common monograms, there's just too much
                            material in the special collections of thousands of libraries across America to digitize by
                            a single entity, a commercial one at that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While even the biggest libraries can't afford to digitize their entire collections,
                            selections from special collections are well within the budgets of even small libraries.
                            As a result, we have seen an increase in digitization projects. </p>

                            lending article requests that we fill. First, it can read the pick slip, and choose the
                            correct method of transmission, grabbing needed ILL and transaction numbers for OCLC and
                            ILLiad.
                            It can also read and enter Ariel, Odyssey, and email addresses, and patron names. After we
                            scan the article, the software can automatically de-skew crooked pages, correct for book
                            curvature, and clean up the margins, so there are no black borders and fingers in the scan.
                            It scans two pages at a time, but separates the one scan into two images. Additionally, by
                            means of ILLiad's Odyssey Helper, BSCAN can update the requests in ILLiad/OCLC to "shipped,"
                            as it sends the article via Ariel, Odyssey, or email.
                            We have been very pleased with this scanner and software, both with the quality of the scans
                            and with the workflow efficiencies it offers. Support for the product by the vendor has also
                            been very satisfactory." </p>
