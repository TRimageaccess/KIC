                KIC is an indispensable study and research tool that enhances reports and papers with crystal clear
                color and black &amp; white pictures, graphs, and excerpts from books, magazines and journals.
                In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC
                can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Preservation, Archive and Interlibrary Loan
                departments.

                    KIC system scan a "two-up" page of a book,
                    analyze the single image, and automatically split
                    the image into two separate images - all in one
                    step that takes just 5 seconds.

                    In addition, the black edges are automatically

                    electronic reserves, course curriculum materials

                The face-up scanning capability of KIC Bookeye 4 and KIC Click&trade; systems enables users to capture
                multiple pages far more easily than ever before -
                books no longer need to be flipped over to turn the page and then flipped back over for each scan or
                copy.
                KIC systems scan up to ten times faster than a typical flatbed scanner and over twice as fast as a high
                speed copier.
                In addition, it produces either color or black &amp; white images for the same cost, which equates to
                substantial savings.
                Finally, KIC promotes a cleaner environment by reducing paper and toner use.

                        KIC's revolutionary True 2 Touch user interface is so intuitive that even the most inexperienced
                        users can immediately scan materials and save them on a USB thumb drive in minutes.

                        Ease-of-use is an essential feature of KIC.
                        The "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons occupy a very large portion of the 17" touch
                        screen.
                        The "Save" button defaults to an output method that is selectable by the institution.
                        If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it
                        will save to the flash drive.
                        Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of
                        output.

                To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's print collections must be available in
                digital format.
                KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve
                digitization, providing a valuable conduit between your print collections and patron PCs.

                KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets.
                Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies.
                They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email, dramatically

            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13Books.png" alt="CCM Books">
            <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of which
                can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over many
                years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law, this
                knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until the books
                disintegrate.</p>
            <img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM13People.png" alt="CCM People">
            <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book scanning
                machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20 pages per
                minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce higher-quality
                digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper</p>
            <p>copiers. The images can cost as little as 1&cent;
                per page and are readable on tablets &amp; smart phones as well as notebooks and regular PCs. The images
                can
                be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard copy.</p>
            <h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
            <p>Paper copiers are as necessary as ever in administrative areas across campus, but copier companies don't
                want to give up that one place they no longer belong, the library floor.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, book spines are being damaged, paper is being wasted, and students are not seeing their
                libraries as the vast free sources for scholarly knowledge that they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brochure-block" id="CCM-14">
            <h3>What can be done?</h3>

                Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to inform the
                libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book scanners that can
                print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular institution. Every year,
                libraries spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet of
                new high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control ever any of that budget money. At these
                institutions, faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase
                these units. If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much
                students value getting unlimited, free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the
                effort to scape together the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
            <p><img src="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/KIC/images/CCM14Women.jpg" alt="">
                Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student technology
                funds.). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one medium KIC
                and one large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much easier
                to justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched copier
                companies that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
            <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic copies
                replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems that scan up to
                20 pages per minute.</p>

                Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used? That is
                just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital (digitize on demand),
                you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide contract with a
                copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>copiers damage books and waste paper</li>
                <li>copiers are slower than scanners</li>

                                the largest format.</p>
                            <p> Nearly all functions can be executed directly at the scanner via the integrated touch
                                screen. The Scan2Net&reg;
                                technology from Image Access forms the basis of the innovative user interface: intuitive
                                to use via web browser or touch screen, providing the operator with direct control over
                                practically every scanner function. Using the touch screen display, up to 30 different
                                (password protected)
                                jobs can be defined and stored. This allows operators to create and store templates and
                                choose any predefined location on one of the network drives as a target for the scanned
                                images.</p>
                            <p> The integrated walk-up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. It
                                allows the user to scan and send images to a specific destination such as a network
                                printer, any directory in the network, or to a USB stick;
                                without having to work with a client PC. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the
                                image, all through the use of the touch screen.</p>
                            <p> A further innovative feature of the WideTEK

                                25: All optical components are encapsulated in a hermetically sealed camera box, making
                                it not only dust-free but also very low maintenance. Cleaning the mirrors and the
                                mechanics is no longer required. State of the art illumination using bright white LEDs
                                guarantees long lifetime
                                (50,000 hour lifetime)
                                and excellent scan results at a very low noise level in spite of its high speed.</p>
                            <p> The WideTEK 25
                                guarantees results at production scanning speeds for high throughput while delivering
                                images in brilliant colors.</p>

                        High Speed Scanning:</span> Image Access scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how
                                powerful your computer is. We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed,
                                without any stops. We

                                're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output
                                are dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our
                                transfer rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your
                                workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer
                                rates (1/2 Gigabit or less). <a
