<div  class="product-overview">
 <h2 class="product-tab">Bookeye 4 - developed particularly with the self-service application market in mind</h2>
  <div class="product-tab"><p>With the latest member of the Bookeye family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users. The efficient Bookeye 4 digitizes source material such as bound documents at high speeds in up to 600 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A2.</p>
   <p>Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and manufacture of the Bookeye 4. The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.</p>
   <p>The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during digitization. The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.</p></div>

 <h2 class="product-tab">Book scanning made easy</h2>
  <div class="product-tab">
   <p>Bookeye 4 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device. Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye 4 can reach unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.</p>
   <p> It takes approximately three seconds for the Bookeye 4 to capture and process the images of two pages of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution. Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan. Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands on the touchscreen. Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive, printed on a connected or network printer, uploaded to an FTP Server or even sent via eMail.</p>
   <p> Bookeye 4's solid functionality, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library. The advantage of a Bookeye 4 over a normal copier is the protective handling of the subject matter to be scanned and the immediate availability of the resulting images to a wider audience. Distribution of the scanned material can be virtually paper free - an ecological argument for Bookeye 4.</p>

 <h2>MORE FEATURES</h2>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">High Speed Scanning:</span>High Speed Scanning: Image Access scanners always run at rated speeds regardless of how powerful your computer is. We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less). <a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/docs/WhitePaper_Scanning_Speed.pdf">Learn more</a> </p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Works Well With Others:</span>Create JPEG, PDF (both searchable and image-only), or TIFF file formats and save to network (PC, server, FTP).</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Easy to Use:</span>Single button scanning, optional foot pedal, built-in display, automatic laser-assisted profile detection and automatic format recognition ensure uncompromised scan results.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">High Duty Cycle:</span>High Duty Cycle: Bookeye scanners are designed for high-volume, professional use. Their duty cycles far exceed that of desktop scanners.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Clear, Crisp, Colorful Scans:</span> Fast scanning in B&amp;W, grayscale and color, high-quality resolution of up to 400 dpi. We've made it our business for over 15 years now to be experts in image resolution, and since there is some confusion among users regarding this matter, we've provided a white paper that debunks some longstanding myths.<a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/docs/WhitePaper_The_Resolution_Myth.pdf">Learn more</a> </p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">State of the Art Illumination:</span> Bookeye's bright white LED illumination lasts significantly longer than other lighting systems. LED lights also consume less power and produce far less heat.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Easy Setup:</span> Bookeye scanners connect over your network using standard IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and can be operated by a standard browser without drivers or add-on cards. </p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">No Warm Up Time:</span> Bookeye scanners are ready to scan anytime you are. Other scanners can require several minutes to warm up before use.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Room to Grow:</span> Firmware upgrades are available online and are directly downloadable to the Bookeye using a standard browser.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Environmentally Responsible:</span> We all know that scanning and saving images to email, USB, etc., rather than photocopying or printing saves paper and toner, but it's hard to get a feel for just how much savings are likely. <a href="http://upload.ted-kteam.com/MIT%20DOCUMENT%20SERVICES%202005-2006%20ANNUAL%20REPORT.pdf">Click here</a> to see an annual report from MIT describing their savings. </p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">Remote Scanner Management:</span> You're in full control from any browser. Change any and all scanner settings remotely or using Bookeye?s built-in touch screen.</p></div>
<div class="product-tab"><p><span class="feature-label">User Statistics Monitoring:</span> Bookeye lets you manage and monitor the usage, statistics and settings of each scanner you own. The reports are automatically uploaded and available online from your web browser.</p></div>
